## Rectangular Grid

How do you test a rectangular grid? What are its properties?

Perhaps we can only test persistence after the cells gain distinguishing
characteristics. We could use object_id, but that is also a design choice: We
only need the grid to return the same value, and shouldn't really care if it's
the same object.

Vice versa, the grid could return the same cell for every location.

## Cells can be dead or alive

Do we need to be able to kill cells in order to test that they can be dead?

Design choices:
- We can make the cell immutable and pass in its state at creation time. This
  means killing a living cell is just replacing it with a dead one.
- We can keep track of the state inside the cell. This gives room for more
  logic and may simplify the updating process.
- How do we find out its state? Options are: a #state method, or state
  predicates. The latter are better from an encapsulation perspective.

If the cells are immutable we can return the same dead cell for each dead
location on the grid, and the same for live cells.
